## Rationale

As part of the [Towards IIIF-Compliance Knowledge in Switzerland](https://campus.hesge.ch/id_bilingue/projekte/ticks/index_fr.asp) (TICKS) project, a white paper titled ["Suggested measures for deploying IIIF in Swiss cultural heritage institutions"](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2640415) was released on May 29th 2019. This project originated on the acknowledgements that the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) (IIIF - 'triple-eye-eff') ecosystem was not enough known and deployed in the cultural heritage field in Switzerland.

This short blog post provides information on the main components of the white paper. These same indications were presented on the occasion of the 2019 IIIF Conference on Wednesday 26th June at one of the lightning talk sessions in Göttingen, Germany - ["Swiss institutions climbing up the IIIF ladder"](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3238160). 

## Main components 

The white paper starts with the main principles of the IIIF, notably indicating the different technical specifications, or application programming interfaces (APIs), produced by the IIIF community as well as the platforms of Swiss projects or institutions that have deployed IIIF. Going from general to specific, a generic IIIF step-by-step graph and six more precise use cases reflecting different needs of the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) sector giving implementation measures have been produced. 

This post focuses on the following four sections: 

- The IIIF ecosystem
- IIIF step-by-step
- Use cases and suggested measures
- Further recommendations

## Perspectives
### White paper future versions

The purpose of this white paper is to be updated as regularly as possible when technical specifications change, for instance, or even to be adapted to other regions or scientific disciplines. It would also be a good idea to have a complete translation or some passages.

Since this document could not have been produced without the help of the wider IIIF community, they would also have to support me with a new version. One way to help me is to comment directly on the Google Doc version: <http://bit.ly/wpticks>. 

### A possible follow-up project
