Six weeks ago I was in Washington D.C. for the [2018 IIIF Conference][2018-iiif] to meet the usual suspects ("IIIFers") as well as new folks from this amazing and growing community. The reasons were threefold:

1. As part of the Program Committee, I couldn't miss an event that we started organizing in December. Speaking of which, it was a great, but time-consuming, experience. 
2. I had a 20-minute presentation on Thursday, May 24th at the Library of Congress about Towards IIIF-Compliance Knowledge in Switzerland [(TICKS)][ticks-rg], the project that Ren√© Schneider, the professor I work with in Geneva, and myself have been conducting. I swear that I haven't reviewed my own proposal. :innocent:
3. I love the social events and informal activities happening around this community. :beers:   

# The workshops

On the [Monday][2018-monday], we had workshops at the S. Dillon Ripley Center, which is near the Smithsonian Castle. I chose to follow:

- *Train the trainer and IIIF Awesome* in the morning 
- *IIIF and Annotations* in the afternoon

[Jason Ronallo][ronallo], Department Head of Digital Library Initatives at the North Carolina State University (NCSU) Libraries, started his Train the trainer workshop (titled here "[Teaching with IIIF][ronallo-teaching]") by asking participants to consider these five key questions:

1. What 1-3 things have you learned from teaching IIIF?
2. What are the challenges to teaching IIIF?
3. What are effective approaches? What's most convincing? What has wowed folks?
4. What questions have you gotten?
5. What resources did you use? What's missing?

I sadly didn't take any notes, but there should be a couple of things that I should be able to recall! Jason and other participants (Emma Stanford from the University of Oxford's [Bodleian Libraries][digital-bod], Sophie Dixon from [Mnemoscene][mnemo], and someone I can't remember) shared with us their experience and gave us their tips as well as ideas on how to run training sessions around IIIF. It was a great 

I really like the visual aspect of Jason's [new version of the workshop][ronallo-workshop] which contains tips, checkmarks, copy-paste fallbacks as well as bonus material and challenge exercices. For the latter, I see it as a real added value because if it's already hard to manage participants who are in difficulty, it is even more chanllenging (in my opinion) to satisfy people who find the exercises too easy and who might get bored. Emma suggested to create ready-to-go toolkits such as HTML5 templates (pointing to an instance of Mirador) for academics who don't have time to understand how to publish IIIF manifests. Sophie talked about her experience on how Omeka can enhance accessibility of smaller archives project, notably with the integration of the [Universal Viewer][uv].

We didn't really have time to go though all of Jason's slides before the morning break. I would have liked it to be slightly longer but I reckon that we did cover most aspects of the workshop. I wonder if next time people could simulate a part of a lesson/worksho/seminar on IIIF.

After the break, Jason talked about the [Awesome IIIF list][awesome-iiif] that is available on GitHub and we went through some issues and pull resquests as a group. I really liked the hands-on approach of [this workshop][ronallo-awesome]. We can also count on new curators of awesome! -- Please join the crew!

After lunch, Matt McGrattan, Head of Digital Library Solutions at [Digirati][digirati], conducted the [IIIF and Annotations][matt-anno] workshop. There wasn't a fixed agenda...

# Strolling around Washington D.C.

When I discover a new place, I like to do it on foot and as a European, I always find that neat city street systems like grid plan or quadrant are fascinating, especially in North America, Australia, and let's be fair some European cities (such as Lisbon). Only in those cities would a walk with three street changes can take you about 50 minutes.

_Also, I recommend AXNO on Florida Avenue, they have great ciders._

# The IIIF Showcase

On a rainy and stormy Tuesday there was a showcase. 

[The IIIF Showcase][2018-tuesday] was a free event that took place in the Library of Congress Coolidge Auditorium. [Kate Zwaard][kzwa], Director of Digital Strategy at the LoC, opened the showcase by giving a great speach on how the IIIF ecosystem could empower end users. She also acknowledged the great work done by institutions and inviduals from the IIIF community.
