## [First, a little bit about me]

My name is Julien Antoine Raemy and I come from Fribourg, Switzerland. I am a bookseller by trade and I used to work for a book distributor and in a bookshop. After receiving my Certificate of Vocational Education and Training of Bookseller in August 2008 (or in French: _Certificat fédéral de capacité de libraire_), I decided to brush up on my English and I did a six-month internship in the [ELT Marketing Department of Oxford University Press][elt] in the UK. I would have loved to stay a bit longer but I had to go back to Switzerland in order to fulfill the mandatory military service period, which I did in one go in ten months.

Then, I worked here and there before I decided that it was time to travel again in Australia (also, I still needed to improve my English skills). I went to Syndey and studied there for about seven months between September 2011 and April 2012. It was all great but I didn’t really know what to do. I thought it would be a good idea to become an English Teacher for some time in Poland so I undertook an intensive four-week course in July 2012 to obtain a [Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (CELTA)][celta]. Once more, it was a great experience to live and work in Warsaw for almost ten months. Nevertheless, I decided to go back to Switzerland to seek meaningfulness. But what shall I do?

## [Then, the more interesting stuff about what I do now]

Between September 2013 and July 2017, I undertook on a part-time basis a Bachelor in Library and Information Science (LIS) at the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts, [Haute école de gestion de Genève (HEG-GE)][heg] in Geneva, Switzerland. Between January 2015 and the end of my bachelor's degree, I was also  working for the [EPFL’s MetaMedia Center][metamedia] as a Photo Archivist for the Montreux Jazz Digital Project. I really enjoyed to work and study at the same time.

Since August 2017, I've been working as a [Research and Teaching Assistant at the HEG-GE][bilingue_id_assistanat] for the Professor René Schneider and besides working on his [research projects][bilingue_id_projets], I help him to coordinate the bilingual curriculum in LIS (French/German).

Since September 2018, I started a [Master's degree in Information Science][master-is] in addition to my work. This programme is expected to end in August 2020.

## [What about this website?]

This website is about my work, views and expectations on information retrieval, semantic web technologies, user-centred design, the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)][iiif], digitisation, digital preservation, open science, research data management, and all sorts of things related to digital data curation in the cultural heritage field. From time to time, I think this website will also be dedicated to personal matters, music, and literature.
