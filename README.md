## Welcome to my website!

I am about to export most of the contents from http://julienaraemy.wordpress.com and use GitHub instead to host my thoughts. It is also a good way for me to learn Markdown.

## Thanks to Michael Rose

I have cloned the Minimal Mistakes [4.10 release](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/4.10.0) to build my website. Thanks to @mmistakes and his great [quick-start guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
