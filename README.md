# Julien A. Raemy
A Library and Information Science Specialist at your service. This website is about my work, views and expectations on information retrieval, semantic web technologies, user-centred design, the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](http://iiif.io/), digitisation, digital preservation, open science, research data management, and all sorts of things related to digital data curation in the cultural heritage field. From time to time, I think this website will also be dedicated to personal matters, music, and literature

## Thanks to Michael Rose

I have cloned the Minimal Mistakes [4.10 release](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/4.10.0) to build my website. Thanks to @mmistakes and his great [quick-start guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
